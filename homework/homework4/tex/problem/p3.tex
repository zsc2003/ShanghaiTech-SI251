\section{Monotone Operators and Base Splitting Schemes}
{\color{red} (35 pts)}
Proof the theorem below:
\begin{theorem}
For \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\), the solution of the equation
\begin{equation}
u^* = (I - JW)^{-T}v
\end{equation}
is given by
\begin{equation}
u^* = v + W^T\tilde{u}^*
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the identity matrix and \(\tilde{u}^*\) is a zero of the operator splitting problem \(0 \in (F + G)(u^*)\), with operators defined as
\begin{equation}
F(\tilde{u}) = (I - W^T)(\tilde{u}), \quad G(\tilde{u}) = D\tilde{u} - v
\end{equation}
where \(D\) is a diagonal matrix defined by \(J = (I + D)^{-1}\) (where \( J_{ii} > 0 \)).
\end{theorem}
